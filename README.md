## Overview

**VeriMox** is a lightweight disaster recovery verification utility for **Proxmox Backup Server (PBS)**.

It automatically restores the latest VM backup, boots the restored VM in isolation, captures a screenshot (e.g. Windows login screen), and optionally uploads the result to a FastAPI backend or dashboard for visual auditing.

To ensure integrity and prevent false positives, VeriMox performs **SHA-256 hashing of screenshots**, confirming that each restore is a unique, valid result â€” not a repeated or stale image.

This project will be released as open source once it reaches a stable beta stage.  
It was originally developed as part of a broader infrastructure automation system and is now shared with the wider community.
